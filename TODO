     Switching to multithread server:
-100 :  gethosbyname() is not thread-safe.
-100 :  rewrite.y
-100 :  stat.c and stat-related issuses: get rid of mmap, compile in the
	stat support only if USE_SNMP is true; redesign raduse to use
	snmp queries instead of peeking in radstat.
-80  :  spawn statement in config is obsoleted (update docs).	
-50  :  Include pth library in the distribution, update configure.in
	accordingly.
-30  :  retransmit proxy (and possibly auth?) requests
	
     General:	
-100 : Provide a scheme function for setting radclient_debug variable.
-50  : Add \ line continuation to read_raddb_files.
-50  : do_not_resolve is global. Possibly could be used in radwho (-n)
-50  : Get rid of radscm (or build it only on systems that do not support
       shared libraries). Build a shared Guile module instead.	     
-10  : Clean up the semantics of log_init/log_done.
-3   : Enable use of port number in rewrite:check_unix()
0    : Multiple servers per realm? (Rasmus Aveskogh <rasmus.aveskogh@utfors.se>)
5    : Write radctl substitute which would use SNMP.
5    : Write a unified configuration utility in guile.
10   : Need a more flexible IP allocation strategy
