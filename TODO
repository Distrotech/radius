TODO for GNU Radius

* Redesign configuration files. The goals are:
** get rid of the mess in raddb, replacing it with a single 
logically structured configuration file.
** restructure the packet matching logic (from hints,huntgroups,users)
to allow for writing more complicated and logically structured rules.
Possibly this will allow to get rid from the so-called 'server
attributes', this will make dictionary simpler and clearer.
** The current configuration file system should be supported as well.

* Get rid of radscm (or build it only on systems that do not support
shared libraries). Build a shared Guile module instead. Make
server queue a SMOB instead of a hidden list.

* The server:
** Add \ line continuation to read_raddb_files.
** Clean up the semantics of log_init/log_done.
** Enable use of port number in rewrite:check_unix()?
** Add include feature to config files that don't have it.
** Revise the possibility of listing memory and queue usage via
snmp.
** Add missing SNMP MIBS and check the compliance of the snmpserv.c
to RFC 2619,2621
** Move the radtest functionality to the test shell and remove radtest
altogether?

* Redesign raduse to use snmp queries instead of peeking in radstat.
* Write radctl substitute which would use SNMP.
* Revise radtest to make it more useful.
