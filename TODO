-100 : Add \ line continuation to read_raddb_files.
       do_not_resolve is global. Possibly could be used in radwho (-n)

-10  : Clean up the semantics of log_init/log_done.
-3   : Enable use of port number in rewrite:check_unix()
0    : Multiple servers per realm? (Rasmus Aveskogh <rasmus.aveskogh@utfors.se>)
5    : Write radctl substitute which would use SNMP.
5    : Write a unified configuration utility in guile.
