     Switching to multithread server:
-50  :  Fall back to pth if POSIX threads are not available?

     General:
-100 : rewrite: Boolean shortcut optimization is broken
-100 : rewrite: fix passing of %[User-Password]	
-100 : Get rid of radscm (or build it only on systems that do not support
       shared libraries). Build a shared Guile module instead. Make
       server queue a SMOB instead of a hidden list.
-50  : Add \ line continuation to read_raddb_files.
-50  : redesign raduse to use snmp queries instead of peeking in radstat.
-10  : Clean up the semantics of log_init/log_done.
-3   : Enable use of port number in rewrite:check_unix()
5    : Add include feature to config files that don't have it.
5    : Write radctl substitute which would use SNMP.
5    : Write a unified configuration utility in guile.
10   : Need a more flexible IP allocation strategy
