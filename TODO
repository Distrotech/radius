* Get rid of radscm (or build it only on systems that do not support
shared libraries). Build a shared Guile module instead. Make
server queue a SMOB instead of a hidden list.

* Add \ line continuation to read_raddb_files.
* redesign raduse to use snmp queries instead of peeking in radstat.
* Clean up the semantics of log_init/log_done.
* Enable use of port number in rewrite:check_unix()
* Add include feature to config files that don't have it.
* Write radctl substitute which would use SNMP.
* Write a unified configuration utility in guile.
* Need a more flexible IP allocation strategy
