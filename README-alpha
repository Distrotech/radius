This is the GNU Radius package.

* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet. If you
are taking source from CVS, you will need to have libtool, automake, and
autoconf installed to help contribute. The script autogen.sh is provided to
help autoconfigure mailutils from the cvs src.  After you run
autogen.sh, there should be a file 'INSTALL' with (generic)
installation instructions. Refer to file 'README' for radius-specific
installation instructions. 

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate or
incomplete. Take a look at ChangeLog to see the latest changes. ChangeLog
entries marked with an asterisk in column zero document user-visible changes
which are not otherwise documented. Thus, the following command will print
a list of latest user-visible changes:

	grep '^\*' ChangeLog


Report bugs to <bug-gnu-radius@gnu.org>

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the CVS repository:

To checkout the source tree from CVS issue the following command:

CVS_RSH=ssh \
 cvs -d :ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/radius checkout radius

Make sure SSHv2 is used.

This will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write access,
contact <gray@mirddin.farlep.net>

* Building

In order to build this you will need to call the auto* tools with
the right arguments, see or run autogen.sh. After this, make sure
you run the first configure with --enable-maintainer-mode option.
This is needed for make to correctly rebuild the dependencies.

* Debugging

Unless you compile Radius statically, use the following command to debug it
(from radiusd directory):

	libtool --mode execute gdb radiusd [args]

If you run the command from /radiusd subdirectory, the file .gdbinit will
authomatically be loaded that contains many useful debugging functions (see
below).

For debugging from Emacs run:

	M-x gdb RET gud-wrapper radiusd RET

(the script gud-wrapper is located in /scripts subdirectory)

* .gdbinit

The default radiusd/.gdbinit ensures that radiusd will be started
in foreground single-process mode. It sets breakpoints at several
critical locations. It also provides following macros:

Macro:         pt arg
Argument type: grad_avp_t *
Description:   Prints the type of the A/V pair in symbolic form
