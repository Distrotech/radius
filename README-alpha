This is the GNU Radius package.

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet. If you
are taking source from CVS, you will need to have libtool, automake, and
autoconf installed to help contribute. The script autogen.sh is provided to
help autoconfigure mailutils from the cvs src.  After you run
autogen.sh, there should be a file 'INSTALL' with (generic)
installation instructions.

Report bugs to <bug-gnu-radius@gnu.org>

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the CVS repository:

To checkout the source tree from CVS issue the following commands:

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/radius login

Press enter when prompted for a password.

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/radius checkout radius

This will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write access,
contact <gray@mirddin.farlep.net>

In order to build this you will need to call the auto* tools with
the right arguments, see or run autogen.sh. After this, make sure
you run the first configure with --enable-maintainer-mode option.
This is needed for make to correctly rebuild the dependencies.
