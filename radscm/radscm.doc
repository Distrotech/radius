[radscm.c]


(rad-format-code DEST-BOOL CODE-NUMBER)

Format a radius reply code into a human-readable form.
DEST-BOOL has the same meaning as in format.

[boot.scm]


(rad-format-pair DEST-BOOL PAIR)

Format a radius attribute/value pair for output.
DEST-BOOL has the same meaning as in format.
PAIR is eihter 
		(cons NAME-STRING VALUE)
	or
		(cons ATTR-NUMBER VALUE)
Where VALUE may be of any type appropriate for the given attribute.
[boot.scm]


(rad-print-pairs DEST-BOOL PAIR-LIST)

Output the radius attribute/value pairs from the PAIR-LIST.
DEST-BOOL has the same meaning as in format.
PAIR-LIST is a list of pairs in the form
		(cons NAME-STRING VALUE)
	or
		(cons ATTR-NUMBER VALUE)
Where VALUE may be of any type appropriate for the given attribute.

All "Reply-Message" pairs from the list are concatenated and displayed
as one.
[boot.scm]


(rad-format-reply-msg PAIR-LIST . TEXT)

Concatenate and print text from all "Reply-Message" pairs from the
PAIR-LIST. If TEXT is specified, it is printed before the concatenated
text.

[boot.scm]


(rad-send PORT-NUMBER CODE-NUMBER PAIR-LIST . VERBOSE)
Sends a radius request. Actually it does the same work as rad-send-internal
but if VERBOSE is specified, the verbose report about interaction with
the radius server is printed.

Return:

On success
	(list RETURN-CODE-NUMBER PAIR-LIST)
On failure:
	'()
[boot.scm]


rad-server-list

A list of radius servers. Each element of the list is:
	(list ID-STRING HOST-STRING SECRET-STRING AUTH-NUM ACCT-NUM CNTL-NUM)

	HOST-STRING	Server hostname or IP address
	SECRET-STRING	Shared secret key to use
	AUTH-NUM	Authentication port number
	ACCT-NUM	Accounting port number
	CNTL-NUM	Control channel port number
Thus, each entry can be used as an argument to rad-client-set-server or
rad-client-add-server.
