              I. Installation
           ---------------------		
  To install do:

1. ./configure [options]
  For the list of available options consult INSTALL file.
  The applications-specific options are:

  --enable-yydebug	         
     Enable parser debugging. The parser debugging can be useful to track down
  errors in configuration files such as /etc/raddb/users and /etc/raddb/config.
  To enable the debugging on a given file, the first line of it should contain
  the statement #debug starting on the first colon. Debugging output goes to
  stderr or to the file /var/log/radius.stderr if such file exists.

  --with-auth-port=NUMBER	 
     Specify port number to use for authentication. Default is 1645. The
  default port number for accounting is computed as auth_port + 1.

  --enable-add-libs=STRING 	 
     Specify any additional libraries/libpaths your system might require.

  --enable-add-includes=STRING   
     Specify any additional include files/include paths.
 
  --enable-shadow	         
     Enable shadow support. Use this only if ./configure was unable to 
  correctly determine if it should use the shadow support.

  --enable-pam		         
     Enable pam support.

  --enable-dbm[={dbm|ndbm}]      
     Enable dbm support. If no argument is specified, an usual DBM is enabled.
  The `ndbm' argument instructs to enable support of NDBM.

  --enable-sql={mysql|postgres}                 
     Enable SQL accounting support. Currently MySQL and PostgreSQL interfaces
     are supported.

  --enable-snmp                  
     Enable SNMP support.

  --enable-notify	         
     Enable TTL notification. This can be used to set the per-user session
  timeouts depending on their accounts.

  --enable-livingston-menus	 
     Enable support for Livingston-compatible menus.

  --enable-deny-shell=SHELL
     Always reject users with given shell.

  --enable-osfc2	          
     Enable OSFC2 support.

     The following is designed for future use. Currently the Norwegian locale
  (bokmal) is being finished.

  --enable-nls		         
     Enable national language support. 

  --with-languages=LIST          
     Set a list of languages to include in NLS.

  --with-catobjext=EXT          
     Override default .po extension.

  --with-instobjext=EXT          
     Override default .mo extension.

  --with-msgfmt=PROG             
     Use PROG instead of msgfmt.

  --with-gnu-msgfmt=PROG         
     Use PROG instead of GNU msgfmt.

2. make

3. If guile version 1.4 or higher is installed on your system, you can do
	make check
   to check the functionality of the package without installing it.

4. make install

              II. Some configuration issues:
           ------------------------------------		

  Files raddb/users raddb/hints and raddb/huntgroups all follow the same
syntax:

input       : username check_pairs reply_pairs
	    ;

check_pairs : pairs
            ;

reply_pairs : pairs
            ;

pairs       : NULL
            | pairlist
            ;

pairlist    : pair
            | pairlist ',' pair
            ;

pair        : attribute op value
            ;

op          : '=' | '!=' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>='
            ;

value       : NUMBER
            | IPADDR
            | DATE
            | QUOTE
            ;

username    : STRING
            ;

attribute   : STRING
            ;

  Terminal symbols are as follows:
STRING   is a character string consisting of alphanumeric characters,
         underscore, dash and a dot. Note that it is not required to
         start with an alphabetic character.
NUMBER   is any decimal number.
IPADDR   is either a hostname or an IP address in dotted quad notation.
         When a hostname is specified it must be enclosed in a pair of
         double quotes, e.g. "host.dom.ain". An IP address may be specified
         either as is, or in a pair of double quotes.
DATE     date in a form:
		"Mon DM YEAR"
	 where
		Mon  is a three-letter abbreviation of a month name
		DM   is a two-digit day-of-month number
		YEAR is a full year number. 
QUOTE    is any character string enclosed in a pair of double-quotes.
NULL     is a word NULL, meaning empty pairlist.

  Special usernames DEFAULT and DEFAULT%d, where %d means any decimal number,
are reserved. When authenticating a request, radius first tries to find
the exact match on username and check_pairs. If such a match cannot be found
it tries to find a DEFAULT entry matching the check_pairs. All DEFAULT
entries are tried in the order of their appearance in the file.
  When comparing pairlists, order of pairs is not significant. Special
attributes (the ones with number > 254) appearing in a pairlist are ignored.

              III. Special hacks for some peculiar NASes		
           ------------------------------------------------

GNU Radius includes packet rewriting support which makes it possible
to cope with some NASes which do not follow the protocol. The support
for following NASes is already included:

	1. MAX Ascend which sends packed NAS-Port-Id attributes
	2. Specialix Jetstream with peculiarities in handling
           usernames longer than 10 characters.
	3. Cisco AS5300	used for VoIP.

Support for another NASes can easily be added without recompiling Radius. 
See accompanying documentation (Ref. "rewrite").

		IV. Testing.		
           ------------------------------------------------

Use radtest. Note that you will need guile version 1.4 or later installed
on your system.

1. To test authentication do

	radtest -l LOGIN -p PASSWD -P PORT-ID --auth

2. To test accounting do

	radtest -l LOGIN -p PASSWD -P PORT-ID -s SESSION-ID --start
or
	radtest -l LOGIN -P PORT-ID -s SESSION-ID --stop

Here,
	LOGIN		is the user's login name
	PASSWD		is his password. Use `.' (dot) to get prompted
			for the password as passwd(1) does.
	PORT-ID		is the port number
	SESSION-ID	is a session ID (a string uniquely identifying
			the session). It can be an arbitrary string
			when used with --start option. It should be
			a session ID of a previously started session
			when used with --stop option.

For example, supposing user `hamlet' has an entry in the users file,
the following would authenticate it and open a session for it:

	radtest -l hamlet -p guessme -P 1 -s "0001" --start

Now, if you run radwho, you would get something like:

     Login             Name What  TTY     When     From        Location
hamlet           hamlet      PPP  S001  Mon 07:22 localhost    255.255.255.254

radlast shows the following;

hamlet      local    001 127.0.0.2       Thu Mon 07 07:22 - still logged in

radwtmp begins Fri Dec 01 16:36:59 2000

Then, suppose you run:

	radtest -l hamlet -P 1 -s "0001" --stop

This will send a stop record for session 0001. Radlast would then show
something like:

hamlet      local    001 127.0.0.2       Thu Mon 07 07:22 - 07:25  (00:03) 

radwtmp begins Fri Dec 01 16:36:59 2000
