.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRadlast\fR lists the session of specified users, NASes, NAS ports
and hosts, in reverse time order. By default, each line of output
contains the login name, NAS short name and port number from where the
session was conducted, host IP address or name, the start and stop
times for the session, and the duration of the session. If the session
is still continuing, \fBradlast\fR will so indicate.
.PP
When specified the \fB-l\fR option, the following fields are output:
login name, NAS short name, port number, prototype, port type, Session
ID, Caller ID, Framed IP address, start and stop time of the session,
and the duration of the session.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -#

\fBradlast\fR will output at most this many lines of information.
For compatibility with some versions of last(1), the
initial \fB-\fR sign can be omitted.
.IP -f
Read the specified file instead of the default \fB\*(RL/radwtmp\fR.

.IP -h
Report the logins from given host. Host can be either a name or a
"dotted quad" internet address.

\fBradwtmp\fR file.

.IP -p

abbreviated, e.g. ``radlast -p 3'' or ``radlast -p S03''.

.IP -s

default days, hours and minutes.

hours and minutes.

.PP
