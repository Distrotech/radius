Ipalloc: A dynamic IP allocator.

* Overview

Ipalloc is a database-driven tool for dynamic allocation of framed
IP addresses for Radius users. The allocation process attempts to
return the last recently used IP on a per-user basis. The less time
elapses between the logout and the next login, the higher are the
user's chances to get the same IP as before.

The tool is implemented as a Guile plug-in module.

* Database description

The pool of IP adresses is kept in two database tables.

** Table naspools

CREATE TABLE naspools (
  nas character(17) default '0.0.0.0' not null,
  pool character(8),
  PRIMARY KEY (nas)
);

This table defines the pools for different terminal servers.

** Table ippool

CREATE TABLE ippool (
  pool character(8) default 'DEFAULT' NOT NULL,
  ipaddr character(17) default '' not null,
  status character(4) default 'FREE' not null,
  time timestamp NOT NULL,
  user_name character(32)  default '' not null
);

Each row in this table represents a single IP adress. The address itself
is stored in the field `ipaddr'. The field `pool' keeps the name of the
pool for this IP. These two fields never change. The rest of fields
keep the state of the row. They are:

*** status

Keeps the current status of the entry. See user_name below.

*** time

Date/time this entry was last modified

*** user_name

Keeps the user name associated with this address. The semantics of
this field varies depending on the value of `status' according to the
following table:

Value of status   |	user_name meaning
------------------+---------------------------------------------------------
'FIXD'		  |	This user should always be given this IP address.
'ASGN'		  |	The IP address is assigned to this user
'RSRV'		  |	The IP address is temporarly reserved for this user. 
'BLCK'		  |	The IP address is blocked and should never be used.
------------------+---------------------------------------------------------

* Operation

Before processing each request, ippool retrieves from the naspools
table the name of the IP pool for this NAS. The value of the
RADIUS attribute NAS-IP-Address is used as the lookup key for
this table.

** Authentication

When an authentication request arrives, ipalloc first attempts to
find an IP the user was assigned at his last login. To do so, it
looks up the database entries with the matching pool and user_name
whose status is set to 'FREE' or 'RSRV'. If found, status columns of
such entries are reset to 'RSRV'. Then, ipalloc selects the first
entry and returns the value of its `ipaddr' column.

Otherwise, if no matching entries were found, ipalloc selects the last
recently used entry for this pool whose status is set to 'FREE', sets
its status to 'RSRV', its user_name to the user name from the packet,
and then returns the IP address associated with it.

If no free entries are found, the above process is repeated 10 times with
a 500 microseconds intervals between the retries (these numbers may
be changed, see the chapter 'Configuring ipalloc.scm' below).

Thus, after the processing of an authentication request, the entry listing
the framed IP for the user is marked as 'RSRV'.

** Start of the session

When the session is started, an accounting request arrives with the
Acct-Session-Type attribute set to Start. Then the ipalloc looks up
the entry with the matching pool and user_name and the value of status
filed set to 'RSRV'. If such an entry is found, its status is changed
to 'ASGN', thus ensuring it will not be used until the user logs out.

Otherwise, if no start request arrives, this entry will eventually
be reused as described in the 'Authentication' paragraph above.

** End of the session

When the user ends the session, an accounting request arrives with the
Acct-Session-Type attribute set to Stop. Upon its arrival, ipalloc
looks up an entry with the values of poll and user_name matching the
request, and status column set to 'ASGN'. If such an entry is found,
its status is reset to 'FREE', thereby returning this entry to the pool.

** Fixed and blocked IP addresses

The allocation process makes sure the entries marked as 'BLCK' will never
be used. On the other hand, marking an entry with 'FIXD' will ensure the
user will always receive this IP address.

* Usage

The module is installed in $prefix/share/radius/ipalloc.scm. To
enable it, modify the following files:

** raddb/config 

Add the following statement:

guile {
      load "ipalloc.scm";
};

** raddb/users

Add the following entry:

BEGIN   Scheme-Procedure = "ip-alloc"
	Fall-Through = Yes

This will ensure that the ip-alloc procedure will be called by each user
profile.

** raddb/hints

To the beginning of file add the following entry:

DEFAULT Scheme-Acct-Procedure = "ip-alloc-update"
	Fall-Through = Yes

* Configuring ipalloc.scm

** Number of attempts and the delay between them.

The variable `ipalloc-max-attempts' sets the maximum number of lookup
attempts.

The variable `ipalloc-sleep-time' sets the delay in microseconds
between the two consecutive attempts.
