The @command{radauth} utility sends the Radius server Access-Request
packet and displays the result it gets. It can be used to test the
configuration files. The usage is:

@example
radauth [-v] username password
@end example

The @option{-v} or @option{--verbose} option forces @command{radauth} to be
verbose on output.

If you enter @samp{.} (dot) instead of the password, the program
will disable echoing on the screen, prompt you to enter the password,
and turn the echoing on again, thus preventing the password from being
compromised.

The program determines which Radius server to use, the authentication
port number and shared secret following the procedure common for all
client scripts (@pxref{config}).
