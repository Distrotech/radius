Exceptions to the generalities below, and special cases, are collected
alphabetically at the end.

(c/e) means a decision by me.  (Texinfo) means following the
  recommendation or usage of the Texinfo manual.  (spec) means
  specified by Lisa.  (GCC) means extracted from the GCC Coding
  Conventions.

Spelling:  U.S.

Serial comma is used:  user login name, user password, and NAS IP.
  (Texinfo)

Quotation marks:  
  Logical style is used for punctuation:  Only what belongs to the
    quotation goes inside.
  Singlequotes are normally used to form names of strings.

Hyphens:
  Prefixes are not normally hyphenated:  sublist (c/e)
  Noun phrase used as adjective or verb is sometimes hyphenated; I
    have followed the author's usage if consistent & clear.
  Noun + participle or other adjective is hyphenated as adjective:
    user-defined
  Symbol + noun is hyphenated as noun:  IP-number
  Yoke between grammatically equivalent words:  Ordinary hyphen is
    used unless one or the other side contains a space or hyphen:
    attribute-value pair

Possessives:  Chicago rules:  Jones's (c/e)
Contractions allowed:  Let's

Acronyms & the like:  Most are small cap (& have special coding), but
  a few are full cap.  The latter are listed in the alphabetical
  section below, as are all in which the MS is inconsistent and I have
  chosen one or the other.

"Which" vs. "that":  "That" preferred in restrictive clauses (c/e)
"Shall" is not used:  68

Common-gender pronouns:  Trade off unobtrusively between masculine &
  feminine, in a ratio of about 3:1 (spec).

Hierarchy of subheadings:  4.5.1  54-56
