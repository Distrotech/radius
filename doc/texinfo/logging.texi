GNU Radius reports every event worth mentioning. The events are
segregated by their severity level. Radius discerns the following
levels (in order of increasing severity):

@table @code
@item Debug
The debug messages @ref{Debugging}.

@item Auth
Under this level every authentication attempt is logged. This is enabled
by setting
@example
level auth;
@end example
@noindent
in @code{category auth} statement of @file{config} file.

@item Proxy
Messages regarding proxy requests @ref{Realms}.

@item Info
Informational messages.

@item Notice
Normal, but significant conditions.

@item Warning
Warning conditions. These mean some deviations from normal work.

@item Error
Error conditions. Usually these require special attention.

@item CRIT
Critical conditions due to which Radius is no longer able to continue
working. These require urgent actions from the site administrator.

@end table

By default, all messages in all levels are output to file
@file{radlog/radius.log}. In addition, messages in level
@code{CRIT} are also duplicated to the system console. These defaults
can be overridden using @code{logging} statement in @file{raddb/config} file
@ref{logging,,logging statement}, @ref{Naming conventions}.
