@chapter User-Name
@vindex User-Name

@example
ATTRIBUTE  User-Name         1                    string  
@end example

This Attribute indicates the name of the user to be authenticated or
accounted. It is used in Access-Request and Accounting attributes. 
The length of the username is usually limited by some arbitrary value.
By default, Radius supports usernames up to 32 characters long. This
value can be modified by redefining @code{RUT_USERNAME} macro in
include/radutmp.h file in the distribution directory and recompiling the
program.

Some NASes have peculiarities about sending long usernames. For example,
Specialix Jetstream 8500 24 port access server inserts a @samp{/}
character after the 10th character if the username is longer than
10 characters. In such cases, we recommend to apply rewrite functions
in order to bring username to its ``normal'' form @ref{rewrite}.

@chapter Password
@vindex Password

@example
ATTRIBUTE  Password          2                    string  
@end example

This Password attribute indicates the password of the user to be
authenticated, or the user's input following an Access-Challenge.
It is only used in Access-Request packets.

On transmission, the password is hidden.  The password is first
padded at the end with nulls to a multiple of 16 octets.  A one-
way MD5 hash is calculated over a stream of octets consisting of
the shared secret followed by the Request Authenticator.  This
value is XORed with the first 16 octet segment of the password and
placed in the first 16 octets of the String field of the Password
Attribute.

If the password is longer than 16 characters, a second one-way MD5
hash is calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the
shared secret followed by the result of the first xor.  That hash
is XORed with the second 16 octet segment of the password and
placed in the second 16 octets of the String field of the 
Password Attribute.

If necessary, this operation is repeated, with each xor result
being used along with the shared secret to generate the next hash
to xor the next segment of the password, to no more than 128
characters.

@example
ATTRIBUTE  CHAP-Password     3                    string  
@end example

This Attribute indicates the response value provided by a PPP
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) user in
response to the challenge.  It is only used in Access-Request
packets.

The CHAP challenge value is found in the CHAP-Challenge Attribute
(60) if present in the packet, otherwise in the Request
Authenticator field.

@vindex NAS-IP-Address

@example
ATTRIBUTE  NAS-IP-Address    4                    ipaddr  
@end example

This Attribute indicates the identifying IP Address of the NAS
which is requesting authentication of the user.  It is only used
in Access-Request packets. Each Access-Request packet should contain
either @code{NAS-IP-Address} or @code{NAS-Identifier} attribute
@ref{NAS-Identifier}.

@chapter NAS-Port-Id
@vindex NAS-Port-Id

@example
ATTRIBUTE  NAS-Port-Id       5                    integer 
@end example

This attribute indicates the physical port number of the NAS which
is authenticating the user.  It is only used in Access-Request
packets.  Note that this is using "port" in its sense of a
physical connection on the NAS, not in the sense of a TCP or UDP
port number.

Some NASes try to encode various information in the NAS-Port-Id
attribute value. For example MAX Ascend terminal server constructs
@code{NAS-Port-Id} concatenating line type (one-digit), line number
(two-digits), and the channel number (two-digits) thus producing
a 5-digit port number. In order to ``normalize'' such encoded
port numbers we recommend to use a rewrite function @ref{rewrite}.
A rewrite function for MAX Ascend servers is provided in the
distribution.

VALUE      Service-Type      Call-Check           10      

VALUE      Service-Type      RADIUS-Administrative-User 20      
@end example

This attribute indicates the type of service the user has
requested, or the type of service to be provided.  It may be used
in both Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.

When used in an Access-Request the Service type represents a
hint Radius server that the NAS has reason to believe the user
would prefer the kind of service indicated.

When used in an Access-Accept, the Service type is an indication
to the NAS that the user must be provided this type of service.

The meaning of various service-types is as follows:

@table @code
@item Login-User
The user should be connected to a host.

@item Framed-User
A Framed Protocol should be started for the User, such as PPP or SLIP.
The @code{Framed-IP-Address} attribute @ref{Framed-IP-Address} would
supply the IP address to be used.

@item Callback-Login-User
The user should be disconnected and called back, then connected to a host.

@item Callback-Framed-User
The user should be disconnected and called back, then a Framed Protocol
should be started for the User, such as PPP or SLIP.

@item Outbound-User
The user should be granted access to outgoing devices.

@item Administrative-User
The user should be granted access to the administrative interface
to the NAS from which privileged commands can be executed.

@item NAS-Prompt
The user should be provided a command prompt on the NAS from which
non-privileged commands can be executed.

@item Authenticate-Only
Only Authentication is requested, and no authorization information needs
to be returned in the Access-Accept

@item Call-Check
@itemx Callback-NAS-Prompt
The user should be disconnected and called back, then provided a command
prompt on the NAS from which non-privileged commands can be executed.

@item RADIUS-Administrative-User

@chapter Framed-IP-Address
@vindex Framed-IP-Address

@example
ATTRIBUTE  Framed-IP-Address  8                    ipaddr  
@end example

This Attribute indicates the address to be configured for the
user.  It may be used in Access-Accept packets.  It may be used in
an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that
it would prefer that address, but the server is not required to
honor the hint.

The value 0xFFFFFFFF (255.255.255.255) indicates that the NAS should
allow the user to select an address. The value 0xFFFFFFFE (255.255.255.254)
indicates that the NAS should select an address for the user (e.g. assigned
from a pool of addresses kept by the NAS).  Other valid values indicate
that the NAS should use that value as the user's IP address.

When used in a reply pairlist, the value of this attribute can
optionally be followed by a plus sign. This usage means that
the value of NAS-Port-Id must be added to this IP address before
replying. For example

@example
	Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.0.1+
@end example

Also @ref{Add-Port-To-IP-Address}.

VALUE      Framed-Compression  Van-Jacobson-TCP-IP  1       
@end example

This Attribute indicates a compression protocol to be used for the
link.  It may be used in Access-Accept packets.  It may be used in
an Access-Request packet as a hint to the server that the NAS
would prefer to use that compression, but the server is not
required to honor the hint.

More than one compression protocol Attribute may be sent.  It is
the responsibility of the NAS to apply the proper compression
protocol to appropriate link traffic.

This attribute is a unique Accounting ID to make it easy to match
start and stop records in a log file.  The start and stop records
for a given session must have the same Acct-Session-Id.  An
Accounting-Request packet must have an Acct-Session-Id.  An
Access-Request packet may have an Acct-Session-Id; if it does,
then the NAS must use the same Acct-Session-Id in the Accounting-Request
packets for that session.

This attribute tells the server which type of authentication
to apply to a paricular user. It can be used in check-pairs of
the user's profile. @xref{Authentication}.

Radius interprets values of @code{Auth-Type} attribute as follows:

@table @code
@item Local
The value of the @code{Password} attribute from the record is taken
as a cleantext password and is compaired against the @code{Password} value
from the input packet. 

@item System
This means that a user's password is stored in a system password type.
Radius queries the operating system to determine if the username/password
supplied in the incoming packet are OK.

@item Crypt-Local
The value of the @code{Password} attribute from the record is taken
as an MD5 hash on the user's password. Radius generates MD5 hash
on the supplied @code{Password} value and compares both strings.

@item Reject
Authentication fails.

@item Accept
Authentication succeeds.

@item SQL
@itemx Mysql
The MD5-encrypted user's password is queried from the SQL database
@ref{SQL Auth}. @code{Mysql} is an alias maintained for compatibility
with other versions of Radius.

@item Pam
The username/password combination is checked using PAM.

The @code{Huntgroup-Name} can be used either in check-pairs of the
@file{users} file record or in reply-pairs of the @file{huntgroups}
file record.

When encountered in check-pairlist of a particular @file{users} profile,
this attribute indicates the huntgroup name to be matched. Radius looks
up the corresponding record in the @file{huntgroups} file. If such
record is found, each A/V pair from its reply-list is compaired against
the corresponing pair from the request being processed. The request
matches only if it contains all the attributes from the specified
huntgroup, and their values satisfy the conditions listed in the
huntgroup pairs.

For example, suppose that the athentication request contained the
following attrbutes:

@example
User-Name = "john",
Password = "guess",
NAS-IP-Address = 10.11.11.1,
NAS-Port-Id = 24

@noindent
Let us further suppose that the @file{users} file contains the following

@example
users_group     NAS-IP-Address = 10.11.11.1
                NAS-Port-Id < 32

Then the authentication request would succeed since it contains

VALUE      Strip-User-Name   Yes                  1       
@end example

The value of @code{Strip-User-Name} indicates whether Radius should
strip any prefixes/suffixes specified in the user's profile from the
user name. When set to @code{Yes} the usernames would be logged and
accounted without any prefixes/suffixes.

A user may have several usernames for different kind of services. In
this case differentiating the usernames by their prefixes and stripping
them off before accounting would help keeping accounting records
consistent.

For example, let's suppose the @file{users} file contains:

@example
DEFAULT Suffix = ".ppp",
                Strip-User-Name = Yes,
                Auth-Type = SQL
        Service-Type = Framed-User,

        Service-Type = Framed-User,
                Framed-Protocol = SLIP
@end example

@noindent
Now, user @samp{johns} having a valid account in SQL database
logs in as @samp{johns.ppp}. He then is provided the PPP service,
and his PPP session is accounted under username @samp{johns}.
Later on, he logs in as @samp{johns.slip}. In this case he is
provided the SLIP service and again his session is accounted
under his real username @samp{johns}.

VALUE      Fall-Through      Yes                  1       
@end example

The @code{Fall-Through} attribute should be used in reply-list.
If its value is set to @code{Yes} in a particular record, it
indicates to Radius that it should continue looking up another records
even when this record matches the request. It can be used to provide
default values for several profiles.

Consider the following example. Let's suppose the @file{users} file
contains the following:

@example

johns   Auth-Type = SQL
                Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.251,
                Fall-Through = Yes

smith   Auth-Type = SQL
                Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.252,
                Fall-Through = Yes

DEFAULT NAS-IP-Address = 11.10.10.1
        Service-Type = Framed-User,
                Framed-Protocol = PPP

@end example

@noindent
Then after successfull matching of a particular user's record,
the matching will continue until it finds the DEFAULT entry,
which would add its reply pairs to the reply pairs for
this request. The effect is, that if user @samp{johns} authenticates
successfully it gets the following reply pairs:

@example
        Service-Type = Framed-User,
        Framed-Protocol = PPP,  
        Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.251
@end example

@noindent
whereas user @code{smith} gets

@example
        Service-Type = Framed-User,
        Framed-Protocol = PPP,  
        Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.252

VALUE      Add-Port-To-IP-Address  Yes                  1       
@end example

If this attribute is present in the reply-pairs and has the value
of @code{Yes}, then the value of @code{NAS-Port-Id} attribute from
the authentication request will be added to the value of
@code{Framed-IP-Address} attribute from the reply pairs, and 
resulting value will be returned in @code{Framed-IP-Address}
attribute to the NAS.

This provides the simplest form of organizing IP address pools.

This attribute is implicitly added to the reply pairlist when the
value of a @code{Framed-IP-Address} attribute ends with @samp{+}
sign. For example the following:

@example
	Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.0.1+

When present in reply-pairs, the @code{Exec-Program} attribute specifies
the full pathname and arguments for the program to be executed when the

The command line can reference any attributes from both check and reply

Before the execution of the program @code{radiusd} switches to
uid and gid of user @code{daemon}, group @code{daemon}. You can
override these defaults by setting variables @code{exec-program-user}
and @code{exec-program-group} in configuration file to proper values
@ref{option,, The option statement}.

The daemon does not wait for the process to terminate.

@noindent
Then, upon successful matching, the program

attributes from the request check pairs.

The deamon will wait until the program terminates. The return value
of its execution determines whether the entry matches. If the program
exits with a non-zero code then the match fails. If it exits with a
zero code, the match succeeds. In this case the standard output of the
program is read and parsed as if it was a pairlist. The attributes
thus obtained are added to the entry's reply attributes.

Then, upon successful matching, the program

The @file{/usr/local/sbin/telauth} can, for example, contain the

The @code{Login-Time} attribute specifies the time range when the user
is allowed to log in. The attribute should be specified in check-pairs.

Format of the @code{Login-Time} string is the same as that of UUCP
time ranges. The following description of time range format is
adopted from the documentation for Taylor UUCP package:

A time string may be a list of simple time strings separated with a
vertical bar @samp{|} or a comma @samp{,}.

Each simple time string must begin either with a day of week abbreviation
(one of: @samp{Su}, @samp{Mo}, @samp{Tu}, @samp{We}, @samp{Th},
@samp{Fr}, or @samp{Sa}), or @samp{Wk} for any day between Monday and
Friday inclusive, or @samp{Any} or @samp{Al} for any day.

Following the day may be a range of hours separated with a hyphen using
24 hour time.  The range of hours may cross 0; for example
@samp{2300-0700} means any time except 7 AM to 11 PM.  If no time is
given, calls may be made at any time on the specified day(s).  

The time string may also be the single word @samp{Never}, which does not
match any time.

Here are a few sample time strings with an explanation of what they
mean.

@table @samp

@item Wk2305-0855,Sa,Su2305-1655

This means weekdays before 8:55 AM or after 11:05 PM, any time Saturday,
or Sunday before 4:55 PM or after 11:05 PM.  These are approximately the
times during which night rates apply to phone calls in the U.S.A.  Note
that this time string uses, for example, @samp{2305} rather than
@samp{2300}; this will ensure a cheap rate phone call even if the
computer clock is running up to five minutes ahead of the real time.

@item Wk0905-2255,Su1705-2255

This means weekdays from 9:05 AM to 10:55 PM, or Sunday from 5:05 PM to
10:55 PM.  This is approximately the opposite of the previous example.

@item Any

This means any day.  Since no time is specified, it means any time on
any day.

and reply pairlists using attribute macros @ref{Macro substitution}.

For example the following @file{users} entry

@example
guest   NAS-IP-Address = 11.10.10.11,
                Calling-Station-Id != ""
                Auth-Type = Accept
        Replace-User-Name = "guest#%C@{Calling-Station-Id@}",
                Service-Type = Framed-User,
                Framed-Protocol = PPP
@end example

@noindent
Allows usage of PPP service for username guest, coming from NAS
@samp{11.10.10.11} with non-empty @code{Calling-Station-Id} attribute.
The string consisting of @samp{#} character followed by
@code{Calling-Station-Id} value is appended to the username.

The @code{Rewrite-Function} attribute specifies the name of the
rewriting function to be applied to the request. The attribute
may be specified in either pairlist in the entries of
@file{hints} or @file{huntgroups} configuration files.

The corresponding function should be defined in @file{rewrite} as

@example
integer @var{name}()
@end example

@noindent
i.e. it should return integer value and should not take any arguments.

@example
ATTRIBUTE  Match-Profile     2004                 string
@end example

The Match-Profile attribute can be used in check and reply lists of a
user profile. Its value is the name of another user's profile (target
profile). When Match-Profile is used in the check list, the incoming
packet will match this profile only if it matches the target profile.
In this case the reply pairs will be formed concatenating the reply
lists from both profiles.
When used in the reply list, this attribute causes the reply pairs
from the target profile to be appended to the reply from the current
profile if the target profile matches the incoming request.

For example:

@example
IPPOOL  NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.10.1
                Framed-Protocol = PPP, Framed-IP-Address = "10.10.10.2"

IPPOOL  NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.11.1
                Framed-Protocol = PPP, Framed-IP-Address = "10.10.11.2"

guest   Auth-Type = SQL
                Service-Type = Framed-User,
        Match-Profile = IPPOOL
@end example

In this example, when user ``guest'' comes from NAS 10.10.10.1 he is
assigned IP address 10.10.10.2, otherwise if he is coming from NAS
10.10.11.1 he is assigned IP address 10.10.11.2.
