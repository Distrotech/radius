@cindex NAS
@cindex Network Access Server

The main purpose of Radius is to centralize authentication of users coming
from various network stations. Its primary usage is for dial-in users,
though it can be used for any kind of network connection.

Radius uses the Client/Server model. The main server keeps the centralized
user database. Each user's profile in this database determines which services
are allowed for this particular user.

The Network Access Server (NAS in short) is a machine that actually provides
a service for the user. It can do so, e.g. by running a pool of modems the
users can connect to. Otherwise, it can be a machine connected to the network
and allowing some form of remote access, like telnet or ssh. It can even be
a workstation allowing console logins to it. Whichever service it provides
the NAS sends the request to the central Radius server in order to determine
whether the user trying to access the service is allowed to do so. Such
request carries information about user's login name, password, NAS
identifier (such as its IP address), etc.

On receiving such request Radius server retrieves from its database
a profile corresponding to the user's login name. The profile basically
consists of two parts: a checklist used for authentication and a reply
list used for authorization. The server checks the authenticity of the
user using first part of the retrieved profile. If this check succeeds,
it uses second part of the profile to authorize the user, i.e. to
determine which service he should be provided. Then, the server responds
with the parameters of the service, such as connection speed, framed IP
address, etc. If any of the described checks had failed, the server sends
the negative response.

If the server needs some additional information in order to process the
request, it asks the NAS to supply such information. Thus, for example, if
the user is allowed to use several services, he can be asked which one of
them he wishes to use, etc.

When NAS receives the positive authentication response, it initiates the
connection.

The NAS can be configured to notify Radius server about such events as
session start, session stop or changing some parameters during the
session. It can also notify the server about other events, such as NAS
shutdown or startup. This is called @dfn{accounting} and the radius server
responsible for processing this information is called an @dfn{accounting
server}.

@cindex Attribute
@cindex Attribute-Value pair
@cindex A/V pair

The information the Radius requests carry is stored as a list of
@dfn{Attribute-Value pairs}. Each pair consists of @dfn{Attribute
number} and @dfn{Attribute value}. The @dfn{Attribute number} identifies
the type of information the pair carries and the @dfn{Attribute Value}
keeps the actual data.

The Value part of an attribute can contain the data of one of the
following types:

@table @asis
@item Integer
A 32-bit unsigned integer value.
@item IP-number
An IPv4 IP-number.
@item String
A character string up to 253 characters long.
@end table

For convenience, the attributes and the values of some frequently used
integer attributes are given symbolic names. These names are assigned to
attributes and values in the dictionary file @ref{dictionary file}.

The attribute numbers range from 1 to 255. The attributes with the numbers
greater than 255 are used internally by the sever and cannot be sent to
the NAS.

The special attribute 26, @dfn{Vendor-Specific}, is available to allow
vendors of the NAS hardware or software to support their own extended
attributes. @ref{Vendor-Specific,, Vendor-Specific attribute}.

The code field identifies the type of the request. 

@item Identifier
The number in the range 0-255 used to match the request with the reply.

@item Length
The length of the request packet.

@item Authenticator
The 16-byte hash value used to authenticate the packet.

@item Attributes

The list of attribute/value pairs carrying actual information about the
request.

@node Authentication requests, Accounting requests, , Requests
@subsection Authentication requests
@cindex Authentication requests
@cindex requests, authentication

A NAS sends authentication requests (packets with code Access-Request)
to a RADIUS server when a user is trying to connect to that NAS. Such
requests convey information used to determine whether a user
is allowed access to the NAS, and any special services requested for
that user.

An Access-Request must contain a @code{User-Name} attribute
@ref{User-Name}. It should contain either a @code{NAS-IP-Address}
attribute or @code{NAS-Identifier} attribute, or both of them.
It also must contain either a @code{Password} attribute or @code{CHAP-Password}
attribute. These attributes are passed encoded using a method based
on the RSA Message Digest Algorithm MD5.

The Access-Request should contain a @code{NAS-Port} or @code{NAS-Port-Type}
attribute or both unless the type of access being requested does
not involve a port or the NAS does not distinguish among its
ports.

Upon receiving Access-Request packet for a particular user and
authenticating that user, Radius server replies to the NAS that
has sent the packet with either of the following packets:

@itemize @bullet
@item Access-Accept
@item Access-Reject
@item Access-Challenge
@end itemize

Radius replies with Access-Accept packet when it has successfully
authenticated the user. Such reply packet provides specific
configuration information necessary to begin delivery of service to
the user.

Radius replies with Access-Reject packet when it was unable to
authenticate the user. Such packet may contain a descriptive
text encapsulated in one or more @code{Reply-Message} attributes.
The NAS may display this text along with its response to the
user.

Radius replies with Access-Challenge packet when it desires to
obtain more information from the user in order to determine its
authenticity or to determine the kind of service to be provided
to the user.

An Access-Challenge packet may include one or more @code{Reply-Message}
attributes, and may also include a single @code{State} attribute, or
none. No other Attributes are permitted in an Access-Challenge.

On receipt of an Access-Challenge, the Identifier field is matched
with a pending Access-Request.  Additionally, the Response Authenticator
field must contain the correct response for the  pending Access-Request.
Radius discards invalid packets and issues appropriate log message.

If the NAS does not support challenge/response, it treats an
Access-Challenge as though it had received an Access-Reject instead.
Otherwise, upon receipt of a valid Access-Challenge the NAS prompts the
user for a response, possibly displaying the text message provided in
@code{Reply-Message} attributes of the request. It then sends its
original Access-Request with a new request ID and Request Authenticator,
with the @code{Password} attribute replaced by the encrypted user's
response, and including the @code{State} attribute from the
Access-Challenge, if any. 

@comment **L3***************************************************************
@node Accounting requests, , Authentication requests, Requests
@subsection Accounting requests
@cindex Accounting requests
@cindex requests, accounting

Accounting-Request packets are sent from a NAS to a Radius server
to allow for accounting of a service provided to a user.

Upon receipt of an Accounting-Request, the server attempts to record
the accounting packet @ref{Accounting}, and if it succeeds in doing
so it replies with an Accounting-Response packet. Otherwise it sends
no reply, which then causes the NAS to retransmit its request within
a preconfigured interval of time. Such retransmits will continue until
either the server responds with an Accounting-Response packet or a
preconfigured number of retransmits is reached, whichever occurs first.

Any attribute valid in an Access-Request or Access-Accept packet
is also valid in an Accounting-Request packet, except the following
attributes, which are never present in an Accounting-Request packet:

@itemize @bullet
@item User-Password
@item CHAP-Password
@item Reply-Message
@item State
@end itemize

Either @code{NAS-IP-Address} or @code{NAS-Identifier} must be present in an
Accounting-Request.  It should contain a @code{NAS-Port} or
@code{NAS-Port-Type} attribute or both unless the service does not involve a
port or the NAS does not distinguish among its ports.

If the Accounting-Request packet includes a Framed-IP-Address,
that attribute MUST contain the actual IP address of the user.

@node User Profile, Request processing, Requests, Operation
@section User Profile

A record in the radius database containing all the authentication and
authorization data for a given user is called a @dfn{User Profile}.
The profile consists of three distinct parts:

@table @asis
@item User Name
This is used as a primary look-up key. Two special user names are
reserved: DEFAULT and BEGIN. These will be described in detail
below.

@item Check List
The list of attribute-value pairs used for matching the profile against
an incoming request.

@item Reply List
The list of attribute-value pairs that are used if the profile matches
an incoming request.
@end table

The following radius configuration files keep data in a User Profile
format: @file{hints}, @file{huntgroups} and @file{users}. Although
they keep data in similar format, the rules that are used to match
incoming requests against contents of these files differ from file
to file. The following section describes these rules in detail.

@comment *L2****************************************************************
@node Request processing, , User Profile, Operation
@section Processing requests
@cindex Processing requests

Upon receiving request Radius applies to it a number of checks to
determine whether the request comes from an authorized source. If these
checks succeed, the request is processed and answered. Otherwise, the
request is dropped and corresponding error message is issued (@pxref{Logging}).

The following checks are performed:

@table @asis
@item Check if the username is supplied
If the packet lacks @code{User-Name} attribute it is not processed
@item Check if the NAS is allowed to speak
The source IP address of the machine that sent the packet is looked
up in the @file{clients} file (@pxref{clients file}). If no match is found,
the request is rejected. 
@item Compute the encryption key
Using the data from the packet and the shared key value from the @file{clients}
file, Radius computes the MD5 encryption key that will be used to decrypt
the value of the @code{Password} attribute.
@item Determine the realm the request belongs to.
[FIXME]
@item Process user-name hints.
@dfn{User-name hints} are special rules that modify the request
depending on user name and his credentials. These rules allow to divide
users into distinct groups, each group having its own authentication
and/or accounting methods. The user-name hints are stored in
@file{raddb/hints} (@pxref{hints file}).
@item Process huntgroup rules.
@dfn{Huntgroup rules} allow to segregate incoming requests depending
on the NAS and/or port number they came from. These rules are stored in
@file{raddb/huntgroups} (@pxref{huntgroups file}).
@item Process individual user profiles.
This step applies only to authentication requests.

@node Realms, Hints, , Request processing
@subsection Realms
@cindex Realms

We call a @dfn{realm} a community of users served by a single Radius
server. Several such servers can co-operate with each other thus allowing
users from a particular @dfn{realm} to be authorized using another
@dfn{realm}'s server.

Let's illustrate this concept. Suppose an ISP has its affiliates in two
different cities, and each of these affiliates is using its own Radius
server. Let's call the affiliates @dfn{A} and @dfn{B} and let's call
the corresponding servers @dfn{radius.a} and @dfn{radius.b}. If the
user of affiliate @dfn{A} moves to city @dfn{B} he is no longer able
to use the service provided by @dfn{radius.a}, neither is he able to
use the service provided by @dfn{radius.b} because he is not in the
users database of the latter. To solve this situation, both Radius
servers should be able to share their database information with each
other. This is done by a very simple means: if user @samp{foo}
connects to the equipment of the @dfn{B} and authenticates itself as
@samp{foo@@A} then Radius server @dfn{radius.b} knows that the
user belongs to another realm and passes the request to server
@dfn{radius.a}. When the latter responds, server @dfn{radius.a} 
simply passes the response back to NAS. In other words @dfn{radius.a}
server acts as a proxy between the NAS to which the user is trying
to connect and the Radius server which is responsible for authenticating
the user.

@comment **L3***************************************************************
@node Hints, Huntgroups, Realms, Request processing
@subsection Hints
@cindex Hints

@dfn{User-name hints} are special rules that modify the incoming request
depending on user name and his credentials. Hints are stored as a list
of @dfn{User profiles} (@pxref{User Profile}). Upon receiving a request,
@code{radiusd} scans the hints entries sequentially, comparing the
hint's @dfn{User Name} with the value of @code{User-Name} attribute from
the request. If they coincide, then @code{radiusd} appends the contents
of the hint's reply pairs to the request pair-list.

Both user names must match exactly in order for a hint to
take effect, unless the hint's checklist contains either @code{Prefix} or
@code{Suffix} attribute. The special name @samp{DEFAULT} or
@samp{DEFAULT%d} (where %d denotes any decimal number), used as hint's
@dfn{User Name} matches any username.

The two special attributes, @code{Prefix} and @code{Suffix}, may be used
in check pairlist to restrict the match to a specified part of a
user-name. Both are string attributes. The @code{Prefix} instructs
radius to accept the hint only if the username begins with the given
prefix. Similarly, @code{Suffix} instructs radius to accept the hint
only if the username ends with the given suffix. A hint may contain
both @code{Prefix} and @code{Suffix} attributes.

In addition to these two attributes, a hint's check list may
contain @code{User-ID} and @code{Group} attributes. 

The following attributes, when used in a hint's reply list have
special meaning. They are not appended to the request pair-list.
Instead, they are removed after completing their function:
@table @code
@item Fall-Through
If this attribute is present, and is set to @code{Yes}, @code{radiusd}
continues scanning the hints, after processing current entry. This
allows for applying several hints to a single packet.
@item Rewrite-Function
If this attribute is present, the specified rewrite function is invoked.
@item Replace-User-Name
The value of this attribute is expanded (@pxref{Macro substitution}),
and replaces the value of @code{User-Name} attribute from the request.
