Quotation marks:  
  Logical style is used for punctuation:  Only what belongs to the
    quotation goes inside.
  Singlequotes are normally used to form names of strings.

Hyphens:
  Prefixes are not normally hyphenated:  sublist (c/e)
  Noun phrase used as adjective or verb is sometimes hyphenated; I
    have followed the author's usage if consistent & clear.
  Noun + participle or other adjective is hyphenated as adjective:
    user-defined
  Symbol + noun is hyphenated as noun:  IP-number
  Yoke between grammatically equivalent words:  Ordinary hyphen is
    used unless one or the other side contains a space or hyphen:

Acronyms & the like:  Most are small cap (& have special coding), but
  a few are full cap.  The latter are listed in the alphabetical
  section below, as are all in which the MS is inconsistent and I have
  chosen one or the other.

"Which" vs. "that":  "That" preferred in restrictive clauses (c/e)

Common-gender pronouns:  Trade off unobtrusively between masculine &
  feminine, in a ratio of about 3:1 (spec).
