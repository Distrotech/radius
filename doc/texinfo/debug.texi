GNU Radius provides extensive debugging features. These are enabled
either by @samp{-x} command option to the @code{radiusd}
@ref{Invocation}, or by @code{level} statement in debug category
@ref{logging,,logging statement}. Both cases require as an argument
a valid debug specification.

A debug specification sets the module for which the debugging should
be enabled and debugging level. The higher the level is, the more
detailed information is provided. The module name and level are
separated by an equal sign. If the level is omitted, the highest
possible level (100) is assumed. The module name may be abbreviated
to first N characters, in which case the first matching module is
selected. Several such specifications can be specified, in which case
they should be separated by a comma. For example, the following is a
valid debug specification:
@example
        proxy.c=10,files.c,config.y=1
@end example

@noindent
It sets debug level 10 for module @code{proxy.c}, level 100 for
@code{files.c}, and 1 for @code{config.y}.

The modules and debugging levels are subject to change from release
to release. 

@c The following describes shortly the debugging levels for this release
@c of GNU Radius (@value{VERSION}.
