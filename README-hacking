These notes intend to help people working on the Git version of
this package.

* Prerequisites

You need the following packages to build the development version of
GNU radius. We don't make any extra effort to accommodate older versions
of these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version.

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Git <http://git.or.cz>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>
- Libtool <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Rsync <http://rsync.samba.org>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>

You will also need bison (or yacc) and flex. The grammar sources
were written so that any version of yacc or bison should be able to
handle them, however using recent bison is anyway recommended. The lex
sources could theoretically be compiled with AT&T lex. However, it's been
quite some time since I tested it, so using flex is higly recommended.
I use flex 2.5.4.

* Documentation

The accompanying documentation may be inaccurate or incomplete. For
development versions, the authoritative source of information  
about recent changes is the git log. Run `git log' to view it.
Run `make ChangeLog' to convert it to ChangeLog format.

For more information, including a description of some debugging
techniques, see the file README-alpha.

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to clone
Radius from Git. The next step is to get other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages:

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd radius

2. Run

   ./bootstrap

Once done, proceed as described in the file README (section
INSTALLATION).

Normally you will have to run bootstrap only once. However, if you
intend to hack on Radius, you might need to run it again later. In
this case, you will probably want to save some time and bandwidth by
avoiding downloading the same files again. If so, create in GNU Radius
root directory the file named `.bootstrap' with the following
contents:

   --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnulib --skip-po

Replace `$HOME/gnulib' with the actual directory where the Gnulib
sources reside.

For more information about `bootstrap', run `bootstrap --help'.
