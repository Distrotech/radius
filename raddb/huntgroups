# The rules from this file are processed after "hints" and
# before "users".
#
# When matching, first the contents of the incoming request
# is matched against LHS of each entry. When the matching
# entry is found, the contents of its RHS is compared with
# the incoming request. The request is accepted for further
# processing only if the comparison succeeds.
#
# Additionally, Radius adds to the incoming request the attribute
# "Huntgroup-Name = LABEL", where LABEL is the LABEL of the
# matched entry.
#
# See the documentation for more details.

## Example:

## 
## Use the following for NASes that need packet rewriting:
##
#DEFAULT	NAS-IP-Address = 10.0.15.1, Rewrite-Function = "func"	NULL
