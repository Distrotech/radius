# This file defines the `huntgroups' that you have. 
# A huntgroup is defined by specifying the IP address of the NAS and 
# possibly a port range.
#
# Matching is done while RADIUS scans the user file; if it includes the 
# selection criterium "Huntgroup-Name = XXX" the huntgroup is looked up 
# in this file to see if it matches. If there are multiple definitions 
# of the same huntgroup, then the first one that matches will be used.
#

## Use the following for NASes that need packet rewriting:
##
#DEFAULT	NAS-IP-Address = 10.0.15.1, Rewrite-Function = "func"	NULL
##
## Replace 10.0.15.1 with proper IP address and func with the name of
## function to use.
