# When handling an authentication request, the rules from this file
# are processed before "huntgroups" and "users".
#
# When handling an accounting request, this file and "huntgroups" are
# the only files to be processed.
#
# These rules match exactly as those in "users"; On the match the pairs
# from RHS are appended to the request pairs sent by the terminal server,
# using the additivity rules.  
#
# See the documentation for detailed information.
#

# These are some examples:

#DEFAULT	Prefix = "P", Strip-User-Name = Yes
#	Hint = "PPP",
#	Service-Type = Framed-User,
#	Framed-Protocol = PPP
#
#DEFAULT	Prefix = "S", Strip-User-Name = Yes
#	Hint = "SLIP",
#	Service-Type = Framed-User,
#	Framed-Protocol = SLIP
#

## Examples of hints which modify packets.
##

## 1. This appends a calling-station-id value to the username

#DEFAULT	Replace-User-Name = "%C{User-Name}-%C{Calling-Station-Id}"
#		Hint = "CLID"

## 2. This applies "nt_fixup" function to any packets (see raddb/rewrite)

#DEFAULT	Rewrite-Function = "nt_fixup"	NULL
#
