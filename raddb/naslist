# This file contains a list of Network Access Servers (NAS) known
# to radiusd.
#
# Each record consists of following fields:
#
# i.    A valid hostname or IP address for the client.
# ii.   The short name to use in the logfiles for this NAS.
# iii.  Type of device. Valid values are those listed in 
#       /etc/raddb/nastypes file. Two types are predefined:
#       true            Means no check will be made and 1 code
#                       will be returned,
#       false           Means no check will be made and 0 code
#                       will be returned.               
# ** The following is optional:
# iv.   Additional arguments to query NAS with. Multiple arguments 
# should be separated by commas (,) with no intervening whitespace.
# Currently radiusd recognizes following arguments (S means string,
# N - number):
#   a. Common arguments:
#     port=N            Use port number N instead of the default
#     password=S        Use password (community for snmp) 
#   b. Method snmp arguments
#     retries=N         Retry N times before giving up
#     timeout=N         Timeout N seconds on each retry
#     community=S       Use community S 
#   c. Method finger arguments
#     arg=S             Argument to query for. By default it is %u
#                       (username).                     
#     tcp=0             Disable the use of T/TCP for hosts with
#                       a broken TCP implementation.
