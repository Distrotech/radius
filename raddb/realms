#
# This file contains a list of realms. When a user logs in with @realm 
# as the last part of the loginname, the realm part is looked up in this 
# file. If found, the request is sent to the listed remote radius server.
#
# Each record consists of following fields:
#
# 	i.   Realm name.
# 	ii.  Hostname. Optional is :port to use a non-standard port. 
#	     In that case, port is the authenication port and the 
#	     accounting port is taken as port + 1.
#            A reserved word LOCAL means the logins for this realm must
#            be processed locally.
# 	iii. (optional) flag. This can be either strip, meaning to strip
#	     the realm name off the full user name (the default), or
#            nostrip, meaning the realm should not be stripped.
