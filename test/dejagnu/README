Remote testing.

Let's suppose you have built Radius on machine R and wish to test it,
but the machine does not have DejaGNU. In this case you should do
the following:

 1. Choose any machine that does have DejaGNU installed. Let's call it
    `machine L'

 On machine R:

 2. Setup the exec and rlogin service to accept requests from L
    without prompting for password. Consult rshd(8) and rlogind(8)
    (on some systems -- in.rshd(8) and in.rlogind(8)) for instructions
    on how to do that.
 3. Copy test/dejagnu/remote.exp to the machine L. If the file does
    not exist, do
	cd test/dejagnu
        make remote.exp

 On machine L:

 4. Check the connection between L and R. Try `rsh R ls /', this should
    output the contents of root directory on the machine R. Then try
    `rlogin R', this should start your shell on R without prompting you
    for the password. If both tests succeed, go on to step 5.
 
 6. Intar the distribution tarball0
 6. Change to the distribution directory and run ./configure
 7. Change to test/dejagnu and run make site.exp
 8. Append contents of file remote.exp, copied from R in step 3, to the
    end of file site.exp, e.g.:

	cat remote.exp >> site.exp

 8. Run `runtest'. If you have renamed the site.exp in step 8, supply
    the full path to it via environment variable DEJAGNU.
