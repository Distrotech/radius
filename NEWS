NEWS for version 0.93

radscm (radius scheme) is actually a Guile Scheme interpreter with
some special functions added.

SQL accounting to a Postrgres server run

	./configure --enable-mysql=postgres


------------------------------
NEWS for version 0.92.1

The major differences between this implementation of radius and
another existing ones are:

1.	Configurable MySQL support

You don't have to recompile anything if you change your database structure.
All queries are completely configurable.

2.	PostgreSQL support

3.	Fast lookup in the users database.

4.	Support for NASes that don't honor RFC.

Some NASes have particularities in sending Radius packets. These can
be overridden by using special rewriting language which allows to 
modify the contents of a packet on the fly. 

5. 	Configurable support for VSA pairs.

Vendor specific attributes can be added to dictionaries and Radius can
be told the ways of handling them without recompiling.
